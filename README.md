What does “the face” mean in the overwhelmingly digitalized world, when the image, or in a way, the representation of one’s face became ubiquitous? THE FACE of oneself and the others blended into digital canvases we were immersed in, from cell phone screens to displays on street sides.

<i>“Firstly there is the straightness of the face, its directness, its defenselessness. The skin of the face is at its most naked and defenseless (…) The face is exposed, vulnerable as if inviting an act of violence. At the same time, the face is what prohibits us from killing.
The face is meaning, and a meaning without context. I want to say that the Other, within the rectitude of the face, is not an individual in a context. Usually a person is a “character (… ) everything that you can see in a passport, the way one is dressed and presents oneself. And all meaning, in the usual sense of the term, is relative to a specific context: the meaning something has in relation to something else. However the face gives priority to the self. You are you. In this sense, you could say that the face is not “seen”. It can only be embraced by your thought processes: it is uncontainable, it takes you beyond. […] But the relationship with the face is immediately ethical in nature. The face is what you cannot kill, or at least in the sense that says: “thou shalt not kill”. Murder is, of course, a banal fact: one can kill another person; the ethical requirement is not an ontological necessity. Being forbidden to kill does not mean murder is impossible, even if the authority behind the sanction remains in the guilty conscience of the evil that has been done – the malignancy of evil.” 
(Emmanuel Levinas, Ethics and Infinity)</i>

This tool reflects my effort to search the shifting meanings of “THE FACE” within the digital milieu. As its original purpose, this tool tries to offer an opportunity for thinking about “THE FACE” of oneself and the Other.
